[VideoPrism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13217) is a general-purpose video
encoder designed to handle a wide spectrum of video understanding tasks,
including classification, retrieval, localization, captioning, and question
answering. It is pre-trained on a massive and diverse dataset: 1 billion
image-text pairs from [WebLI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06794), 36 million
high-quality video-text pairs, and 582 million video clips with noisy or
machine-generated parallel text (subject to data wipeout). The pre-training
approach is designed for these hybrid data, to learn both from video-text pairs
and the videos themselves. VideoPrism is fairly easy to adapt to new video
understanding tasks, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on 31 out of 33
public video understanding benchmarks using a single frozen model.

This repository releases the model weight checkpoints and hosts [JAX](https://github.com/jax-ml/jax)/[Flax](https://github.com/google/flax) utility
functions for checkpoint loading and model inference.

## Updates

* **[Jun-03-25]:** VideoPrism video encoders (ViT-B and ViT-L) are released. [[`Blog`](https://research.google/blog/videoprism-a-foundational-visual-encoder-for-video-understanding/)] [[`Paper`](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13217)] :fire::fire:

## TODOs

- [ ] Release text encoders for cross-modal retrieval.
- [ ] Add PyTorch model support.

## Getting started

You will need Python 3.9 or later. Download the code from GitHub and run:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/google-deepmind/videoprism.git
$ cd videoprism
$ pip install .
```

Please get started with the following example code for model checkpoint loading
and inference or use the [Colab Demo](https://colab.research.google.com/github/google-deepmind/videoprism/blob/main/videoprism/colabs/videoprism_video_encoder_demo.ipynb):

```python
import jax
from videoprism import models as vp

model_name = 'videoprism_public_v1_large'  # configuration name
flax_model = vp.MODELS[model_name]()
loaded_state = vp.load_pretrained_weights(model_name)

@jax.jit
def forward_fn(inputs):
  return flax_model.apply(loaded_state, inputs, train=False)

model_inputs = ...  # Shape = [batch_size, num_frames, height, width, 3].
outputs = forward_fn(model_inputs)  # Shape = [batch_size, num_tokens, feature_channels].
```

**Note:** Please make sure that the model `apply` function is wrapped in
`jax.jit` to get the correct results.

## Released models

We release the following model variants:

| Model Name | Configuration Name | Model Type | Backbone | #Params | File Size | Checkpoint |
| -------- | -------- | ------- | :-------: | :-------: | :-------: | :-------: |
| VideoPrism-B | `videoprism_public_v1_base`  | Video encoder | ViT-B | 114M | 458MB | [link](https://storage.googleapis.com/videoprism/v1/flax_base_f16r288_repeated.npz) |
| VideoPrism-L | `videoprism_public_v1_large` | Video encoder | ViT-L | 354M | 1.42GB | [link](https://storage.googleapis.com/videoprism/v1/flax_large_f8r288_repeated.npz) |

The models take videos with shape `(num_frames, 288, 288, 3)` as inputs and
outputs embeddings with shape `(num_frames * 16 * 16, feature_channels)` which
could be reshaped into `(num_frames, 16, 16, feature_channels)` for
spatiotemporal representations. During model training, `num_frames` is set to 16
and 8 for VideoPrism-B and VideoPrism-L, respectively. Both models are expected
to work with arbitrary `num_frames` by interpolating the temporal positional
embeddings. The RGB values of input videos should be normalized in [0.0, 1.0].

### Results on video-focused tasks ([VideoGLUE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03166)) with frozen backbones

| Dataset | K400 | MiT | SSv2 | D48 | Charades | ActivityNet | AVA | AVA-K |
| -------- | :-------: | :-------: | :-------: | :-------: | :-------: | :-------: | :-------: | :-------: |
| **VideoPrism-B (public)** | 82.9 | 39.7 | 62.2 | 64.3 | 43.5 | 36.5 | 28.3 | 30.8 |
| **VideoPrism-L (public)** | 85.0 | 43.3 | 64.6 | 67.6 | 53.2 | 37.0 | 32.4 | 34.5 |
| VideoPrism-B (paper) | 84.2 | 40.8 | 63.6 | 67.4 | 40.4 | 36.6 | 30.6 | 31.8 |
| VideoPrism-g (paper) | 87.2 | 45.5 | 68.5 | 71.3  | 62.3 | 37.8 | 36.2 | 37.3 |
| Prior SOTA (B) | 77.1 | 34.0 | 58.2 | 55.6 | 33.3 | 35.8 | 21.1 | 25.9 |
| Prior SOTA (L+) | 82.8 | 40.3 | 67.4 | 69.6 | 39.9 | 36.7 | 24.4 | 26.2 |

*"Public"* denotes models we released in this repository. *"Paper"* and
*"Prior SOTA"* denote our models and previous best-performing models reported
in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13217), respectively. Our *public*
models perform slightly worse than the *paper* models due to different
pre-training image-text data we used subject to data policy.
